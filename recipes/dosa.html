        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup brown rice flour</li>
                <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir the brown rice and whole wheat flours together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water to make a thin batter. Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, turmeric, cumin, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, coriander, ginger, cayenne pepper and rice vinegar until evenly blended. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour, or overnight.</li>
                <li>To cook the dosas, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, spreading it over the bottom in a thin layer. Cook 1 minute, turn, and cook 1 minute more. Remove from the pan. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                <li>Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Brush hot skillet lightly with melted coconut oil, wiping with a paper towel to remove excess oil. Ladle 1/4 cup batter in center of skillet. Using bottom of ladle, quickly spread batter outward in a spiral motion, applying even, constant pressure to form a thin 6- to 8-inch round. (Stop spreading once ladle begins to stick to pan.)</li>
                <li>Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon oil around edge and on top of dosa; cook until bottom browns, edge crisps, and top is set, about 2 minutes. If desired, flip dosa, and cook until second side is very lightly browned, 10 to 15 seconds. Loosen dosa edge using a thin spatula. Add about 3 tablespoons Aloo Masala to half of dosa; fold dosa over filling, and serve immediately. Repeat as desired to make more dosas. Leftover batter can be refrigerated, covered, up to 2 weeks.</li>
